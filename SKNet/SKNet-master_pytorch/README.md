# SKNet

Try to implement the CVPR 2019 paper ["Selective Kernel Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06586) by PyTorch.

I implement the core Slective Kernel Module, as illustrated in the img:

The core SKConv unit is implement as a Pytorch Module in untils.py.

I intend to test in cifar-10 and imagenet, and test in some SR models.
